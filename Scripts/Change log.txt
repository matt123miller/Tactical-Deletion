Followed the Unity live training FSM tutorial, will begin implementing those features to AIM soon, don't think GSM needs it.
Changed CCTVDetect to work better, now raycasts after a timer instead of each frame. Also refactored the racasting into a method Look()
Also need to bring in the new SBS health system.

Attempted to make all alarm related updating use Observer pattern, not sure if it works yet.
Created AlarmTannoy for locational alarms.
Hacked apart GSM and added enum states.
All music and sounds going forward will function something like the sound for Doors

All hidden behind a branch for safety.

Seperated the locking and door opening logic into 2 seperate systems, Strategy Pattern fo lyf.
Made a much better CCTV cam prefab.

This is the most recent build of Tactical Deletion  using Unity 5.2 at the time of writing.

Need to check if all 5.2 stuff has changed properly.

The AI half works and I'm currently working on a pickup inventory system for Passcode Cards found laying around any given level.
One day I'll try moving my AI from a big if() statement into something approaching an FSM model.
